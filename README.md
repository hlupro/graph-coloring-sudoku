# graph-coloring-sudoku
Project that focuses on the relationship between Sudoku and graph coloring algortihms

This project creates two graphs that simulate a 4x4 and 9x9 Sudoku Board. The program then applies a greedy colorign algorithm on the two graphs to see if they will create a viable Sudoku solution.
In order to run this program type ./proj
